## Overview

The `nautobot-device-onboarding` plugin is using the [netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko) and [NAPALM](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libraries to simplify the onboarding process of a new device into Nautobot down to, in many cases, an *IP Address* and a *Location*. In some cases, the user may also have to specify a specific *Device Platform* and *Device Port*.

Regardless, the Onboarding App greatly simplifies the onboarding process by allowing the user to specify a small amount of info and having the app populate a much larger amount of device data in Nautobot.
